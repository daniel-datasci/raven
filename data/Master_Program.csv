Master of digital Transformation ,Information Technology ,18 months,"Considered as a pillar of the fourth industrial revolution, digital transformation is an area of critical importance to companies and governments. The magnitude of this importance was accentuated by the current pandemic, which has led companies to accelerate their adoption of solutions rapidly derived by their own digital transformations. Despite its importance, skills in digital transformation are scarce, and this field is considered a niche, with huge demand for talent in the job market.
To fulfil the need for specialists with digital transformation skills, the University of Wollongong in Dubai is offering a Master in Digital Transformation (MDT) program aiming at equipping students with the knowledge, skills, and mindset required to lead and drive digital transformation initiatives in various industries.
Specifically, the program aims to:

Develop well-rounded professionals who can bridge the gap between business and IT by defining digital transformation strategies and implementing digital solutions.
Enhance students' strategic thinking and problem-solving abilities, enabling them to analyze complex challenges and develop innovative and practical solutions using prominent digital transformation technologies.
Develop students' soft skills, including communication, teamwork, ethics, and professional conduct, to prepare them for success in today's multidisciplinary workplace.
Produce graduates who can drive innovation and create sustainable solutions by effectively utilizing digital technologies and aligning business and IT strategies.


What is Digital Transformation really about and why is it so important nowadays?
Digital transformation is a global phenomenon that has swiftly ascended the priority ladder within organsations worldwide. In essence, digital transformation is the art of reimagining businesses in the digital age. It encompasses the infusion of digital technology into every facet of a business, triggering profound shifts in its operations and value delivery mechanisms.

The relevance of digital transformation cannot be overstated. It is the catalyst for enhanced efficiency, productivity, and innovation. Furthermore, it equips organisations with the tools to comprehend their customers better, resulting in an elevated customer experience. In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), digital transformation stands as a pivotal driver of economic expansion and social progress.

Digital Transformation in Numbers
Here's a glimpse of the numeric potential behind digital transformation:
Digital technology will constitute 25% to 30% of the global gross domestic product (GDP) in the upcoming decade.
Spending on digital transformation is anticipated to surge with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16% in the Middle East region.
The UAE leads the charge in the digital transformation movement across the Middle East.
The UAE's digital economy is projected to surpass $140 billion by 2031, soaring from its current nearly $38 billion status.
Digital technology expenditure in the UAE is forecasted to reach $20 billion by 2026.
The UAE is strategically positioned to double its digital economy's contribution to GDP, from 9.7% to 19.4%, within the next decade.

Key Pillars of a Successful Digital Transformation
Achieving a successful digital transformation rests upon three fundamental pillars:
Strategy: This serves as the blueprint for the journey, outlining the transition from legacy systems to innovative, digitized ones.
Technologies: These are the indispensable tools for implementing and realizing the digital transformation solutions.
Customer Experience: At the apex of this transformation pyramid lies the ultimate objective—to enhance the customer experience, making it seamless, frictionless, and enjoyable.

The Allure of Digital Transformation for Organisations
Why do organisations find themselves drawn to digital transformation? It's because of the manifold advantages it presents. Digital transformation offers substantial potential in terms of process digitization, streamlining, and the automation of manual tasks. The automation of repetitive processes not only translates to significant time and cost savings but also a reduction in errors.
Furthermore, digital transformation adopts a data-driven approach to business. By harnessing the vast reservoirs of structured and unstructured data at our disposal, organisations can glean profound insights into customer needs, desires, product perceptions, and even societal trends. These capabilities converge to deliver an enriched customer experience and a heightened competitive edge in the market.

The 55% Surge in Demand: A Career Catalyst
As McKinsey and Co. forecasts a remarkable 55% surge in demand for technological skills in the coming seven years, it becomes evident that the pursuit of a Master's in Digital Transformation is not merely a degree but a strategic career catalyst. This demand surge paves the way for graduates to step into high-demand roles, shaping the digital destiny of organizations and industries. Armed with a comprehensive understanding of digital transformation principles, graduates can position themselves as invaluable assets to organisations yearning for adept leaders in this transformative journey.
In essence, the challenges embedded within the digital transformation landscape are a crucible wherein students have the opportunity to forge their future. By acquiring the knowledge, skills, and insights offered by a Master's program in Digital Transformation, students can position themselves as the architects of tomorrow's business and technology landscape. They become the bridge between the challenges faced by organisations and the solutions that drive progress and innovation.","Students applying for a master's degree must have completed a bachelor's degree (or equivalent) at an accredited institution of higher education and have achieved the minimum grades outlined below:

Master of Innovation and Entrepreneurship ,Business and commerce ,18-24 months,"Today, we see the words ""innovation"" and ""entrepreneurship"" everywhere, whether in the communication of companies, public institutions or non-profit organizations. Indeed, there is a broad consensus on the importance of innovation and entrepreneurship in addressing economic and social challenges. Innovation and entrepreneurship are now perceived as the cornerstone of sustainable growth. But what is behind these widely used concepts, how and why should they be mastered?


Innovation is a creative process that starts with an idea, continues with the development of an invention and ends with the commercialization of new products, services, processes or practices. Entrepreneurs are those who carry out this process by starting their own business or by leading innovation projects within existing companies. A well-managed innovation process helps an organization to create more value for customers, build customer loyalty, increase profits and attract the best employees.
Therefore, public and private companies are actively looking for those entrepreneurs who have the appropriate skills to manage innovative projects.
UOWD's Master of Innovation and Entrepreneurship degree in Dubai will help you develop the most in-demand skill set to lead business innovation projects or start your own company.


We adopt a comprehensive approach to achieve this objective. You will then develop skills in various fields such as marketing, finance, leadership and management.
